# The website

This repository contains the source code for the website of the Minecraft network.

The website will serve as the central hub for information about the network, including general details, updates, and future features.  
It is being developed using **React** with **TypeScript**, and may also use **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

Feel free to browse through the files on GitHub and explore how everything is structured and implemented.

_A detailed list of features will be added once the project is finished._
