---

I have decided to develop my entire **private** server network and make it open source.

The goal of this project is to provide insight into how a modern Minecraft network can be structured and implemented.  
I hope this helps others who are developing their own network.

You are free to use my code, but you won’t be able to use it 1:1, as your use case will most likely be different.

## Overview

This repository acts as the central place for all parts of the network, including:
- Proxy and backend infrastructure
- Custom plugins and services
- Configuration and shared utilities
- Website and supporting tools

_A more detailed breakdown will be added as the project evolves._

## Details
> Proxy: Velocity `3.4.0-SNAPSHOT`  
> Backends: Paper / Purpur `1.21.1`  
> Java: `22-lts`

## Architecture (planned)

_The architecture diagram will be added once the structure is finalized._
