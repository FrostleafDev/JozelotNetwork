# My whole network is and will be open source

I have decided to develop my entire **private** server network and make it open source.

I hope this helps others who are developing their own network.  
You are free to use my code, but you won’t be able to use it 1:1, as your use case will most likely be different.

## Details
> Velocity version: `3.4.0-SNAPSHOT`  
> Backend versions: `Paper/Purpur 1.21.1`  
> Java: `22-lts`

## Credits
> Currently developed by me alone (`jozelot_`).  
> Please don’t steal haha
